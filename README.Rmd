# socviz 

This is a small R package of datasets and a few functions to support a
data visualization course, and its accompanying book.


## Installation

pkgdown is not currently available from CRAN, but you can install it from github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/socviz")
```

Load the library as usual with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(socviz)
```
